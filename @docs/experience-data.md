# Experience Data Structure

Based on the WorkExperienceCard component, each experience entry should follow this structure:

```typescript
{
  title: string;          // Job title
  company: string;        // Company name
  location: string;       // Location (e.g., "San Francisco, CA" or "Remote")
  description?: string;   // Optional job description (currently commented out in component)
  skills: string[];       // Array of skills/technologies used
  timespan: string;       // Duration (e.g., "Jan 2023 - Present")
  workType: string;       // Type of work (e.g., "full-time", "part-time", "contract", "freelance")
  companyLogo?: string;   // Optional path to company logo image
}
```

## Notes:
1. Keep skill names concise and recognizable
2. Use consistent date format for timespan (e.g., "Jan 2023 - Present")
3. workType should be lowercase and can be: full-time, part-time, contract, freelance, or internship
4. Company logos should be placed in `/public/images/companies/` directory
5. Logo images should be square format for best display (the component shows them as 40x40px)
6. The description field is optional and currently commented out in the component
7. Order experiences chronologically with most recent first
